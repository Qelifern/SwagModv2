Swag Mod Remastered is a recreation of Swag Mod.
Currently adds:
+58 New Items, Weapons and Armour.
+35 Different Projectiles.
+6 New Buffs and Debuffs.
+1 Town NPC.
+9 Blocks and Placeables.
Features World Generation, only spawns ore after you have killed Moon Lord.
Many Weapons are inspired by other games, effects of which have been inplmented in a Terraria way.
This mod is meant to played along side Vanilla Terraria and a few Quality of Life mods.
Calamity Mod's Revengance Mode currently makes Moon Lord not spawn Swag Mod's post-Moon Lord ore.
However for the progression of the Calamity Mod this is good news since many of the weapons that can be crafted after Moon Lord in Swag Mod are pretty overpowered.
